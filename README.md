# STARWALKER---NASA-Space-Challenge
Our project provides seamless access to NASA’s complete public image and map database through any modern web browser. Users can explore celestial bodies — including planets, moons, and asteroids — using multiple satellite layers and high-resolution zoom. Beyond exploration, it functions as a collaborative community map platform, allowing users to create, share, and edit custom maps enriched with pins, paths, descriptions, videos, and images. An integrated AI assistant, trained on NASA datasets, helps users navigate space data, answer questions, and discover insights from NASA missions and imagery.
